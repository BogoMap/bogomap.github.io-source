# Transit map 

These are the sources of the transit map web page.
This repository is the source code of BogoMap (rutas.bogomap.co) and this is based
on the work done by Felix Delattre for MapaNica, a transit map for Managua, Nicaragua.

The source code uses Pelican, and Flex. The Flex theme is modified in order to create
Mombacho a theme to show transit map.

The wiki explains how to modify this code in order to create your own transit map.

The webpage could be hosted on GitHub pages.
The deployement on the webpage is done thanks to Travis-CI.

All this architecture allows you to use a complete open source set of applications
to create your own transit map, deployed and hosted for free.
